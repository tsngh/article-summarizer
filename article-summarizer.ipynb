When John McCarthy coined the term \"artificial intelligence\" in 1955 as \"the science and engineering of making intelligent machines,\" could he have imagined technology’s effect on our ever-growing food supply needs? MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024ByKevin PayneContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024ByCassidy HortonContributor\n",
      "Growing and harvesting food is not the only consideration. According to the United Nations, an estimated 17% of total global food production is wasted, and food that is lost or wasted accounts for 38% of the total energy usage of the global food system. Over time, this can provide invaluable insights that can spur efficiency gains such as improving yield, cutting waste, enhancing nutritional value and minimizing diminishing resources like water and arable land. With AI, farmers are better able to monitor crops to adjust in real time to events like the recent rainstorms in California, or drought conditions, to alter water input or put up canopies. Using AI, you can utilize databases of images differentiating good grain quality from bad to drive sensors that tell the combine to make adjustments, such as shutting down a lower sieve or increasing fan or rotor speed. In 1959, when there were 3 billion people on earth, John McCarthy wrote, “Interesting work is being done in programming computers to solve problems which require a high degree of intelligence in humans.”\n"
